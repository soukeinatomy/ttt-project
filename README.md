# Tic Tac Toe

This is my unfinished tic tac toe project codes, I have named it tic tac meow because I am planning to add gifs of cats moving down the website (hence the big empty space). You will need to scroll down to see the game I have created so far.

I still have a lot to add and better, such as adding cat faces instead of X and Os, Make the reset button better, make the winner loser text appear and disappear better. 
I also want to make it a public link anyone can access to play.
I will also add a 1 vs computer in addition of the 1 vs 1. There is also some styling as well as the teme I need to finish.
I also want to add the line that show there's 3 Xs or Os in a row.
